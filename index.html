        <p>War is a good thing, said no one ever. But what if it's justified like people fighting for rights, or other
            valid reasons to start war? My answer is this, no war is good. Notice how the answer didn’t change, that’s
            because there is no need to wage wars between people. The military is one of the most un occupations that
            doesn’t need to exist. Then why does it exist, when did humans feel the need to arm themselves against other
            humans. I’m not trying to be the next Gandi or MLK but there is a time to start questioning these things
            because it is not normal for us to react so nonchalantly when we hear the news of kids and innocent people
            dying because of war, or even military soldiers, who leave their family in order to fight a war where they
            might not come back from. They say goodbye to their child without knowing if they will be able to say hello
            again. And what about the child who says goodbye to their parent and anxiously wait for their return just
            for another soldier to come and tell them that they aren’t coming home anymore. For a clearer understanding
            of my point there is an article of The New York Times titled "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS Leader Known for
            His Brutality, Is Dead at 48". <a style="color:brown;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/world/middleeast/al-baghdadi-dead.html"> New York times Article</a>

        </p>
        <p> While the person being killed is a threat to other peoples' lives you can't ignore the innocent lives lost
            because of the commotion this generated. And that's the sad reality of war, there are many kids that won't
            grow up because of war and their deaths are justified because it is for the greater good. It is important to
            note that the reason why these wars are waged are a separate factor that usually determines if a war is
            justified or not, but that ignores the point that war itself is terrible, yes at the end we'll be glad that
            certain wars ocurred but the fact that is ignored is the innocent people that died in the wars. Not just the
            soldiers.</p>
