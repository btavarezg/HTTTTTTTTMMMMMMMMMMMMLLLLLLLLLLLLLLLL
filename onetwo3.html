    <div class=intro>
    <p>War is a good thing, said no one ever. But what if it's justified like people fighting for rights, or other valid reasons to start war? My answer is this, no war is good. Notice how the answer didn’t change, that’s because there is no need to wage wars between people. The military is one of the most unnecessary occupations that doesn’t need to exist. Then why does it exist, when did humans feel the need to arm themselves against other humans. I’m not trying to be the next Ghandi or MLK but there is a time to start questioning these things because it is not normal for us to react so nonchalantly when we hear the news of kids and innocent people dying because of war, or even military soldiers, who leave their family in order to fight a war where they might not come back from. They say goodbye to their child without knowing if they will be able to say hello again. And what about the child who says goodbye to their parent and anxiously wait for their return just for another soldier to come and tell them that they aren’t coming home anymore. For a clearer understanding of my point there is an article of The New York Times  titled “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS Leader Known for His Brutality, Is Dead at 48”.

    <p> While the person being killed is a threat to other peoples' lives you can't ignore the innocent lives lost because of the commotion this generated. And that's the sad reality of war, there are many kids that won't grow up because of war and their deaths are justified because it is for the greater good. It is important to note that the reason why these wars are waged are a separate factor that usually determines if a war is justified or not, but that ignores the point that war itself is terrible, yes at the end we'll be glad that certain wars ocurred but the fact that is ignored is the innocent people that died in the wars. Not just the soldiers.</p>
