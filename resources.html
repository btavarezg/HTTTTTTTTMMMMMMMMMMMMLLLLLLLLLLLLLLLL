    <p> the only one I have so far. I got more but I'll import them later when I actually use them so for now I will make a paragraph.The resources here are very resourceful. Becuase they are resourcess. Again this is an attempt to get a paragraph and I'm running out of things that can make this a paragraph. I'm investigating about copyright so I can find a loophole around it because most of the useful information is copyrighted anyways.</p>
